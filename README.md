#  Bookworm

This project is an app to track which books youâ€™ve read and what you thought of them.

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

I learned how to:

- Combine Core Data and SwiftUI
- Create Core Data Entities
- Create a custom component with @Binding
- Use size classes with AnyView type erasure
- Build a list with @FetchRequest

This app was made using the course **100 Days of SwiftUI** from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
